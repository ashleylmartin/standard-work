# 12. Run Installer Test

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Run Installer test.

1. All devices must be in their final locations before starting the Installer test.
2. **DO NOT** test cameras or sensors with them next to the panel. You need to ensure that they are working properly from their final locations.
3. Install repeaters or networking solutions based on the Installer test results.

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/web_use-DBCP-Swappable.jpg" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

### 1. Check the RSSI outside at the doorbell.

* Ask the customer where their existing doorbell chime is located.
* Pull up **Airport Utility** on your phone/tablet.
  * Tap Wi-Fi Scan
  * Tap Scan
  * **Find SSID of the customer's home router:**
    * **2.4GHz:**  Channels 1-13
    * **5GHz:**  Channels 36-165
* **You should be looking for 2.4 GHz channels ONLY.**
  * DBC will **NOT** connect to a 5 GHz channel.
  * If the home router SSID on 2.4 GHz is not between -65 and 0:
    * Add a **Wi-Fi Extender**
    * Install the TP-Link Wi-Fi Extender
      * [**TP-Link WiFi Extender Programming**](https://prosource.vivint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TP-Link-Wi-Fi-Extender.pdf)
  * **Run a Speed Test** using [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net) with the customer’s phone
    * Ensure the customer’s phone is connected to the TP-Link Bridge before running test.
    * At least 5 Mbps Download and 2.5 Mbps Upload speeds are required.

### 2. Check the voltage outside at the existing doorbell location.

* Attempt to locate the **transformer** when possible (the unit will be labeled):
  * 12-24V AC
  * 12-24V DC
  * 10VA
  * 1.0A Min
* If any of the above criteria aren't met, **add a transformer.**
  * If wire size is **18 AWG,** use a **V-AC transformer.**
    * Order **V-AC2-A** from Tech Genie
  * If wire size is **less than 18 AWG,** use a **Take transformer.**
    * Order **1-TAKE-TRANSFORMER** on Tech Genie.

### 3. Check for possibility of pinching wires, or if you'll need to extend wires.

* Install DBC Spacer or Wedge
  * Order **10-DBCSPC-001** in Tech Genie.
  * Order **10-DBCWDG-001** in Tech Genie.

### 4. Go inside and remove wires from the customer's chime box.

* Terminals commonly labeled as **Trans, and Front or Back** are what you're looking for.
  * **DO NOT** touch all three wires together (front, rear, trans) as this can lead to blown transformers.
* **If adding length to existing wires,** twist the wires and trim the ends neatly.
  * Use **Dolphin Clip (Bean Clip)** if the wire size is **smaller than 18 AWG.**
    * Order **1-BEANS** in Tech Genie.
  * Use **Wire Nut (Orange Cap)** is the wire size is **18 AWG.**
    * Order a **Twist-On Wire Connector (5UYJ4)** in Grainger.

### 5. Confirm that power has been terminated.

* Use a **voltmeter** to verify that power has been terminated at the DBC location.

### 6. Go outside and take the doorbell off the front of the house.

* Prep for installation.

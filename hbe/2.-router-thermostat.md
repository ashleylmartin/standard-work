# 2. Router / Thermostat

### 1. Ask the customer where their WiFi Router is located.

* Plug in the WiFi Bridge.

### 2. Ask the customer where their current Thermostat is located.

* Check the wire terminal letters for compatibility.
* Check for the availability of a Common Wire.

### 3. Determine HVAC Type

* If the HVAC is currently in **Cool Mode,** feel for cold air.
* If the HVAC is currently in **Heat Mode,** feel for hot air.
  * **If the heat IS NOT blowing,** don't touch the Thermostat.
  * **If heat IS blowing,** walk outside and see if the Condenser Fan is spinning.
    * **If the fan IS spinning,** the unit is a heat pump.
    * **If the fan IS NOT spinning,** the unit is conventional.
  * **Switch Mode** (cool-to-heat, or heat-to-cold).

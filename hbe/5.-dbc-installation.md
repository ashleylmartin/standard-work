### 2. Install the DBC Pro.

* Use Spacer, Wedge, and Goofplate.
  * **Spacer:** To extend the length of wires ort to hide excess wires.
  * **Wedge:** To angle the view to avoid only looking at the wall.
  * **Goofplate:** To hide large boxes, holes, paint issues, etc.

### 3. Go to the chime box.

* Twist your two wires (Front/Rear and Trans) together and then secure.
  * Use Dolphin Clip (Bean Clip) if the wire is smaller than 18 AWG.
    * Order **1-BEANS** in Tech Genie.
  * Use **Wire Nut (Orange Cap)** if the wire is 18 AWG.
    * Order **Twist-On Wire Connector (5UYJ4)** in Grainger.

### 4. Complete a manual Doorbell Power Test.

* Press and hold the DBC's button for 15 seconds.
* The DBC will verbally say, _"Release now to initiate power test."_
* The DBC ring will light up PURPLE.
* Wait. The DBC will indicate whether the test was successful or not.
* Once completed, the DBC will power cycle and reboot.

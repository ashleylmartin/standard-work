# HVAC/Thermostat Flow

### Why do we have a thermostat "flow?"

We have many stakeholders at Vivint who depend on the proper execution of the thermostat flow to support our field installers and customers. Here are just a few:

* **Customer Care:**  Troubleshooting with customers.
* **Field Tech Support:**  Troubleshooting with Pros.
* **Home Damage Team:**  Processing home damage claims.

{% hint style="danger" %}
### Thermostat Flow Best Practices

* Take level and clear photos of the before/after thermostat wiring and wall plate setup. **Blurry or unfocused pictures should NOT be used.**
* Take care to ensure you have the **correct wiring setup.**
* Ensure the thermostat is **correctly programed** (including identifying the **HVAC fuel type**).
* Prevent damage with **properly-trimmed copper wiring.**
{% endhint %}

### Improved Pro Accuracy

<details>

<summary>What steps can you take to improve your accuracy?</summary>

1. Take accurate **before photos** (these will be the source of truth for future troubleshooting).
2. Use the Thermostat Flow in Tech Genie as a TOOL, **not a TASK.**
3. Identify the **correct fuel type** (Gas or Electric). This is VERY important.
4. Properly **test the system** both **before and after.** Fix problems while you're on-site.
5. Only use **one power source;** either **C-Wire or Batteries.**
6. Program the thermostat from its **FINAL LOCATION.**

<summary>Identifying Gas vs. Electric Furnaces</summary>

* Flue Pipes and Venting always indicate a **gas-powered system.**
* No venting pipes? **The furnace is electric.**

### Examples & Best Practices

<details>

<summary>Exposed Copper Wiring / Dual Thermostats</summary>

* **BE CAREFUL:**  Exposed copper wiring can cause shorts or blown transformers.
* Remember that **dual-thermostats** can be either a **Heat Pump or a Conventional system.**

<details>

<summary>Bad BEFORE Photos</summary>

* When disassembling the existing thermostat terminal, be sure to go until you see the **terminal letters**.
* **Clean any dust or smudges** from the wiring terminal so wires and their positions are clearly visible.
* Confirm you can see the **wires and letters** in your photos.
* **DO NOT** remove wires before taking the photo.

<details>

<summary>Good AFTER Photos</summary>

* The photos of wiring you submit should be **straight forward, clear, and legible** (where you can see all of the letters easily).

# VHE Introduction

## What is "Vivint Home Essentials?"

Vivint Home Essentials (VHE) is our standalone program created to increase customer engagement with smart home technology. The VHE package provides customers with a free standalone system from their energy provider to begin their journey with Vivint.

This system functions autonomously without linking to Vivint’s professional monitoring services. Instead, the customer is prompted to consider upgrades for a more comprehensive smart home experience with professional monitoring.

## What's in the VHE Package?

The customer’s energy provider will supply the customer with the introductory package. The following products make this system a true standalone system, but without the Hub allowing the customer to view and navigate the following products:

* **Doorbell Camera Pro (1)**
* **Chime Extender (1)**
* **Element Thermostat (1)**
* **Zigbee Bridge (1)**

# 7. Key Points

### 1. Pair all devices in their final locations.

### 2. Test the DBC power on the wall and the final power source.

* DO NOT test the DBC on a premade jumper.

### 3. Only use one (1) power source for thermostats.

* If there is a C-Wire, then remove the batteries.
* If there is NO C-Wire, then install the batteries.

### 4. Use the Thermostat Flow as a TOOL, not a TASK.
